Howdy, I'm Luis Rangel, creator of RunRanker here to tell you a little about what went into this app.

I used a library called Retrofit 2 to handle the network connectivity and the handling of the response.

The JSON response that Retrofit obtained was decoded by GSON into Runner objects. 

All the image assets in RunRanker were made by myself using a vector graphics tool called Sketch.
I treated this app like it ws going to client, so I made it a bit better than a simple chart. I like colors.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at luisrangel.person@gmail.com.

Thank you for checking out my project, and I hope you have a nice day!

~Luis (ง^ᗜ^)ง
